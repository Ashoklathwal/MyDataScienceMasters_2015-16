# My self-created Data Science Masters 2015-16

The aim of this repository is to organize and **keep track of my beginnings in Data Science** (from March 2015 to April 2016). I've created it for myself but if it can **provide some information or motivation to other newbies willing to learn Data Science**, I would be happy :). As of April 2016, I didn't complete all my program as *I'm taking a break to work on new projects and find inspiration to build cool & useful data products*.

## My story

I started thinking of studying Data Science end of 2014 as I became fascinated by this field. After some research, I discovered MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and really began self-studying Data Science around March 2015 in my free time. I had absolutely no related background whatsoever. I didn't even know how to write a single line of code. **I started from ground zero**.

I ended up studying Data Science related MOOCs until early April 2016 and creating my own Data Science Masters program. **This program is made of MOOCs** I have chosen relative to the following factors: 

- ***free*** (or financial aid available)
- ***foundational knowledge & skills***
- ***practical projects***
- ***attractive format*** - I prefer well-organized video based courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) & [EdX platforms](https://www.edx.org/)

## Repository content

In this repository you will find:

- **assignments & projects** I've done for completing Data science related MOOCs requiring code writing
- **my Data Science Masters program** below
- **some data analyses & presentations** I've made: [my RPubs profile](http://rpubs.com/Stephaniecnvs)
- **2 reports related to Big Data**, written for my Master in Management (end 2014), with other student team members
- **some course notes** that helped me learn, mostly taken by hand & ***useful to myself only however***
- **my certificates** for MOOCs that were giving free certificates (+ financial aid) and with an active session still running


Some of the codes, apps & documents might be missing, incomplete or simplistic for 2 reasons: 1. it was my very first coding experience 2. when I didn't have enough time before the deadline, I chose to build something simple to complete the project on time.


**Below are all the softwares & tools I've used as of April 2016:**

- R & RStudio
- RStudio Presenter
- R Markdown (+ RPubs)
- Shiny (by RStudio)
- Python Spyder IDE
- iPython notebook
- GraphLab Create from Dato
- SQLite
- Git & GitHub
